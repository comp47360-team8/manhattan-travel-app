## 🌟 Project Overview

**Offpeak** is a trip itinerary planner web and mobile application built for tourists visiting Manhattan, New York. The central problem it addresses is the uncertainty visitors face when planning a day out: which attractions will be overcrowded, when is the best time to visit each one, and how to build a realistic multi-stop itinerary around that.

Offpeak solves this by combining a curated Points-of-Interest (POI) database for Manhattan with a machine-learning busyness prediction model, letting users generate and save personalised itineraries that account for predicted crowd levels, accessibility needs, and trip dates.

## ✨ Features

The app is organised into five tabs, available on both web and mobile:

- **🧭 Explore** — Browse and search Manhattan points of interest. Each POI card shows a photo, name, neighbourhood, rating, crowd level, and a best-time-to-visit hint, plus an accessibility icon (♿) where applicable. Tapping a card opens its detail page, with a 6-slot Crowd Forecast chart (colour-coded Quiet / Moderate / Busy), a "Best Time to Visit" window, and an accessibility section shown by default, listing confirmed wheelchair or step-free access and otherwise linking to the venue's own site.
- **🤖 AI Planner** — A conversational planner: the assistant asks whether you're starting a new trip or refining an existing one in My Itinerary, then gathers trip dates, interests, and accessibility needs through dialogue. Once confirmed, the generated itinerary is saved into My Itinerary.
- **🗓️ My Itinerary** (manual, main flow) — Pick POIs and trip dates directly; the system auto-schedules them into a time-slotted itinerary based on predicted crowd level and location, prioritising Quiet/Moderate slots where possible. Stops can be removed, with the schedule reflowing automatically.
- **🔖 Saved** — POIs can be saved straight from Explore (no itinerary needed) and appear here immediately; saved itineraries can also be reopened in full or deleted.
- **👤 Profile** — Account info (username, joined date) and an accessibility setting (e.g. step-free routes). When enabled, itineraries are restricted to POIs with *confirmed* wheelchair access; places with only partial access, or with no accessibility data, are left out and a warning is shown if you add one anyway.

## 🧠 Machine Learning / Busyness Prediction

Offpeak's crowd forecasts come from a busyness model built on a curated Manhattan POI registry plus public demand signals (transit, taxi, Citi Bike, pedestrian counts, weather, holidays). The target is **Google Popular Times** — a 0–100 score normalised to each place's own typical peak — modelled as a typical-week (day-of-week × hour) profile that the backend serves as the crowd forecast.

The datasets and DB seed that power this live in [`ml/`](ml/README.md).

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 💾 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x and `pip`
- Node.js and `npm`
- PostgreSQL (installed locally, or a GUI client such as [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) or [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/))
- Xcode (for iOS development) — iOS 26

### 🔧 Backend Setup

Backend code resides in the `backend/app` folder:

- FastAPI application entry point: `backend/app/main.py`
- API endpoint definitions: `backend/app/routers/`
- Database connection code: `backend/app/database.py`

**1. Install dependencies**

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Create your `.env` file**

A `.env.example` template file is provided inside `/backend`. Copy it to `.env` and fill in your own values — **anything marked with `**` must be left unchanged** so the variable names match the backend code. Never commit `.env` to GitHub.

**3. Set up a local PostgreSQL database**

Create a database, either via a GUI, or in the terminal:

```bash
psql postgres
```
```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
\c database_name   -- connects to the database
\q                 -- quits the connection
```

**4. Connect PostgreSQL to FastAPI**

In your `.env`, add your database URL:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
```

Replace `username`, `password`, port (usually `5432`), and `database_name` with your actual values. `backend/app/database.py` reads this variable via `os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")` — no code changes needed if your `.env` variable name matches.

**5. Run database migrations (Alembic)**

Alembic is installed via `requirements.txt` and manages the tables defined in `backend/app/models/`.

```bash
git pull origin main
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

Run this command whenever the team announces a database change, then verify the new tables/columns exist.

**6. Seed the database**

Run the following seed scripts **in order**:

```bash
cd backend/db
psql -d your_database_name -f 01_create_poi.sql
psql -d your_database_name -f 03_dml_seed_poi_table.sql
psql -d your_database_name -f 04_dml_seed_busyness_forecast.sql
psql -d your_database_name -f 05_insert_poi_availability_mode.sql
psql -d your_database_name -f 06_dml_update_poi_best_time.sql
psql -d your_database_name -f 07_dml_update_poi_content.sql
```

**7. Run FastAPI**

For web development (paired with the React frontend):

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

FastAPI will run at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), with interactive endpoint docs at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs). Make sure the CORS middleware in `main.py` allows requests from `http://localhost:5173` (the default Vite dev server address) so the frontend can reach the backend.

For mobile development (so a physical device on the same network can reach it):

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

- iOS Simulator → call the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.
- Physical iPhone → call the backend at `http://YOUR_MAC_IP:8000`, with the Mac and iPhone on the same Wi-Fi network.

### 🎨 Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The web app should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 📱 iOS Setup

Build and run the **Offpeak** iOS app in the Xcode **iOS Simulator** on a Mac.
No physical device or Apple Developer account is required.

> **Assumption:** your backend is successfully set up and running locally.
> For Backend setup, please refer to the top-level of this section if you need it.

---

#### 1. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version / Notes |
|---|---|
| macOS | Recent enough to run Xcode 26 |
| **Xcode** | **26 or newer** — the app targets **iOS 26.0** |
| iOS Simulator runtime | **iOS 26.0**  |

> Check with `xcodebuild -version`. If the iOS 26 simulator is missing, install it
> from **Xcode - Settings - Components - Platform Support**.

---

#### 2. Get the code & open the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/comp47360-team8/manhattan-travel-app.git
cd manhattan-travel-app/ios
open ManhattanTravelApp.xcodeproj
```

*(Already have the repo? Just `git pull origin main`.)*

- Scheme: **ManhattanTravelApp**
- Bundle identifier: `com.sean.offpeak`

---

#### 3. Confirm the backend URL

A Debug build already points at default local backend, change accordingly if needed.
see `ManhattanTravelApp/Core/Networking/APIConfig.swift`:

```swift
#if DEBUG
static let baseURL = URL(string: "http://127.0.0.1:8000")! // change accordingly
#endif
```

---

#### 4. Select a simulator and run

1. In Xcode's toolbar (top center), open the run-destination dropdown.
2. Choose any **iPhone** simulator on **iOS 26** (e.g. *iPhone 17 Pro*).
3. Press **⌘R** (or the ▶️ Run button).

Xcode builds, boots the simulator, installs, and launches automatically. The
first build takes a little longer while it compiles from scratch.

**Command-line alternative** (build without launching):

```bash
xcodebuild build \
  -scheme ManhattanTravelApp \
  -project ManhattanTravelApp.xcodeproj \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  -configuration Debug
```

---

#### 5. Verify it works

- **Explore** loads a list of Manhattan POIs with photos.
- Tapping a card opens the detail page with a crowd-forecast chart.
- Sign up / log in, then check Saved and Itinerary.

---

#### 6. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Explore is empty or shows a network error | Backend not reachable. Confirm server is running. |
| "iOS 26.0 is not installed" / no matching destination | Install the iOS 26 runtime: **Xcode - Settings - Components**. |
| Build fails on an old Xcode | The project targets iOS 26 — update to **Xcode 26+**. |
| Photos don't load | Usually transient network; images cache to disk after first load, so a second launch shows them instantly. |
| Can't log in | No user in your local DB yet, sign up first. |

---

## 🧪 Testing

The backend has a [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) suite for the **itinerary scheduling engine** — the app's core algorithm. The tests are pure-logic (no database or network), so they're fast and deterministic.

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt   # requirements-dev.txt adds pytest
python -m pytest
```

They run automatically in CI on every push and pull request (see [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)).

| Test file | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_scheduler.py` | day/slot assignment, closed-POI handling, overflow, and warnings (integration-style) |
| `tests/test_find_best_slot.py` | the "busyness-first" rule that places each POI in its quietest open slot |
| `tests/test_overflow.py` | the overflow cost model (70% busyness / 30% geography) |
| `tests/test_accessibility.py` | the wheelchair-confirmed-only accessibility filter |
| `tests/test_utils.py` | POI-per-day distribution and day-of-week range helpers |

> The web frontend and iOS client do not yet have automated tests.

---

## 📂 Repository Layout

| Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `backend/` | FastAPI + SQLAlchemy API and Postgres schema (Alembic migrations in `backend/alembic/`, seed SQL in `backend/db/`). |
| `frontend/` | Vite / React / TypeScript web client. |
| `ios/` | Native iOS client. |
| `ml/` | **Data / ML side** — intermediate & processed datasets and the POI DB seed that power the busyness feature. See [`ml/README.md`](ml/README.md). |

## 🌐 Deployment

Offpeak is live at **[https://offpeak.live/](https://offpeak.live/)**. See **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)** for the full hosting architecture, DNS, and CI/CD.

- **Frontend:** React + Vite static build on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) — `offpeak.live`.
- **Backend:** FastAPI on [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) (`us-west1`) — reached at `api.offpeak.live`.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + PostGIS on [Neon](https://neon.tech/) (US West).
- **CI/CD:** merging `main` → `production` triggers GitHub Actions ([`deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)) to run migrations, deploy the backend to Cloud Run, and deploy the frontend to Vercel.

### 🔑 Environment variables

The backend reads the variables below (template: [`backend/.env.example`](backend/.env.example)). Locally they live in `backend/.env`; in production they are set on Cloud Run — sensitive ones via **GCP Secret Manager**, the rest as plain env vars.

| Variable | Purpose | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string (pooled in prod) | yes |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | signs auth tokens | yes |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini — primary LLM | yes |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq / Llama — fallback LLM | yes |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | LLM strategy; `fallback` = Gemini with Groq fallback | yes |
| `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` | POI photos; endpoint returns none if unset | optional |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | browser CORS allowlist | optional¹ |
| `ALGORITHM`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` | auth-token settings; have code defaults | optional |

¹ Production doesn't depend on CORS — the web app is same-origin via the Vercel rewrite and iOS is native.
